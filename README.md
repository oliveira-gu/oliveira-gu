# Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Gustavo de Oliveira

I'm currently a Computer Science student (since 2022), and I'm passionate about solving problems and building solutions through software development. I have experience working with a variety of programming languages, with a focus on Java, Python, and C. I believe starting by the foundation of computer science such as operating systems, low-level programming languages as C, helps us to understand better the world of IT. At the moment I'm studying data structures both in C and Java, Linux CLI and Shell Script to prepare myself for the LPI Linux Essentials certification. 

ðŸ’» **Areas of expertise:**
- Software development with Java, Python, and C
- Linux Command Line Interface
- Unit testing with JUnit
- Version control using GIT (GitHub & GitLab)
- Continuous improvement of code quality with SonarQube
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

ðŸ“ˆ **Currently learning:**
- Data Structures both in Java and C
- Enhancing software development practices
